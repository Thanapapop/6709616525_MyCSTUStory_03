        <h2>My future</h2>
        <p class="stor">Since, I'm in high school, I found a person who is a professor in Mahidol university, He work as an actuary scientist.<wbr> He work and doing a test in SOA as well. One of my friend also took a test and pass it recently.
        From this point,<wbr> I really have an inspired for this point and what I want to achieve and test for myself for loving and delicate on the actuary work is becoming one of them.<wbr>
        Even though, I didn't achieve them is because of personal reason. I didn't give up and set a new goal which is becoming a person who working in data.<wbr> As this work require the same skill as a actuary science but, they could
        do in many business while actuary science focus on insurance and financial risk management.<wbr> My future as I grow up, I couldn't decide what's going to do but I'm sure that I working on data field. Here's what my possible career.</p>
        <p class="headline">1.Data Scientist</p>
        <img class="dsci" src="resources/overview.png">
        <p>This is the one that I have interest for a while up until now. For my reason, I think is one of the work with the data and analyze.<wbr> It makes a lot of work such as data cleaning which is troublesome
        or using program to analyze and make a prediction it.<wbr> There's a lot of steps and requirement to do this work. I'm working hard to do on this side of the work as a person. I'm really interest in it.<wbr>
        They've a same skill on data analyst. but they use stat and analyze the data as well they require a lot of skill on math, stats, Al and computer science.<wbr>
        Not just only those skills, Soft skill is also important as well. They generate a meaningful data and plan for organization as well.
        They also finding trend and predict it as well.<wbr> I've work on the mini project and though it was fun. So, I decide to take a step on this field.
        I also thinking that, They're interesting which is why I'm really interested.</p>
        <p class="headline">2.Data engineer</p>
        <img class="dengin" src="resources/data en.jpg">
        <p>For this job, They require the same skill as data scientist and data analyst, They manage the data the most which is raw data.<wbr> I'm currently study on this work.
        They can told what the data gonna need and It's like working on the back-end on web developer but as a data engineer.<wbr> They've been well known for only a few years.
        They also use their software engineering, programming, product development, networking and cloud computing skills to build and manage data warehouses, pipelines and data lakes.<wbr>
        As for me, I couldn't make sure what to do, Data engineer is the one of the work that I really interest as they use computer and
        work with the data the most out of all the work on the data.<wbr> I've study what's job on the data and this is one of them that looks interesting and fun as they work on raw data.</p>
